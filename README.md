# Bioinformatics
**Bioinformatics** is a lovely course whatsoever, if you are curious with technology, coding, biological data like DNA, RNA, proteins sequences then you are at the right place

## Why Bioinformatics?
* Emergence of new species
* Enhancing the discovery of evolutionary relationship (being either orthologous, paralogous,xenologous or analogous)
* Drug development can be ~~posible~~ possible
* Generation of pipelines for the local genes
* Prediction of protein structure by <ins>AlphaFold</ins>
* Machine learning, feeding AI with biological data helping in analysis
* Other things related to bioinformatics

### Goals
* In years to come, hopefully in God's power i will be among the greatest(1 <sup>st</sup>) bioinformatician in my country and worldwide while i increase my knowhows and exposing myself to collaborators.
  
### My interests
* Crazy right, but anyone is allowed to dream big. i would like to keep my focus on viral and bacterial genomics(e.g *Enterobacter bugandensis*)the very species isolated first in our setting thus its name.
